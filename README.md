Module 12 Challenge

## Project Overview
The UK Food Standards Agency evaluates various establishments across the United Kingdom, and gives them a food hygiene rating. For this project, I will evaluate some of the ratings data in order to help their journalists and food critics decide where to focus future articles.

## Analysis
Before I began my analysis, I first used terminal to import a json file of establishments into a uk_food database. I assigned a collection called ""establoshments" to this database to perform my analysis. Using the Eat Safe, Love setup code, I then updated the database to add in a new restaurant called Panang Flavours.

Using the Eat Safe, Love analysis code, I analyzed the following questions:

Question 1: Which establishments have a hygiene score equal to 20? 
* By querying the data, I found a total of 41 restaurants with a hygiene score of 20.
  
Question 2: Which establishments in London have a RatingValue greater than or equal to 4? 
* I could not find any establishments in London with a RatingValue greated than or equal to 4.
  
Question 3: What are the top 5 establishments with a RatingValue of 5, sorted by lowest hygiene score, nearest to the new restaurant added, "Penang Flavours"?

* I found 55 establishments with a hygiene score of 0.
